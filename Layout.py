    To Be Written

    This class stores the base note, frequencies for each scale
    degree of "diatonic notes", frequencies for the accidentals
    (as either EDO-steps or cents or ratios), names for each of
    the notes and accidentals and possibly colors for the notes

    These will be saved in files, this class is just for easily
    working with the files. These files will have the defaults 
    for Johnston notation and HEJI, and maybe a layout for 24ET
    as 12ET plus an accidental for 50c, as a tutorial or what- 
    ever.
