class Note():
    '''
    To Be Written

    This probably stores something, in the last program it sto-
    red accidental information and also note name, but that mi-
    ght be useless in the new program structure? Probably stor-
    es the notes it is tied to and note duration.

class Tuplet():
    '''
    To Be Written

    Acts somewhat like a note, but instead of having accidental
    information and stuff like that, it stores a collection of
    objecs inside the tuplet, the tuplet duration, and the num-
    ber of divisions of the duration the tuplet is. im not 100%
    sure how this will work in practice, so writing these isnt
    super high priority.
