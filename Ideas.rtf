\f0\fs24 \cf0 Ideas:\
[Some of these might be unrealistic but its just a list of things we want]\
\
Interface\
- A nice interface where you can see the instruments and notes and you click on them to edit things\
	- looks good??\
- Recolorable piano roll, customizable piano roll (for custom scales), different layouts for large EDOs and saveable layouts, colors, etc.\
\
Tuning\
- all EDOs with arbitrary tuning notes\
	- subsets of edos?\
	- Default of A = 440Hz but can be changed\
	- Switching between EDOs? Sounds awful\
	- Custom Notation?\
- Complete 31-limit JI (redo the stuff i already have)\
	- Ben Johnston notation, maybe also HEJI + conversion between them\
	- Custom Notation?\
- Custom scales with whatever intervals\
\
Rhythm\
- Tuplets\
	- Nestable tuplets??\
- Actual bpm and not whatever garbege the old program uses\
	- like allow more than two tempos, basically\
- Time signature changes, tempo changes\
	- Polytempo??\
	- I write a lot of prog so hopefully\
\
Instruments\
- A few actually good customizable synths + a sampler, probably\
- If we can find it some electric guitar with a lot of effec options? I love my psych and prog rock\
- saveable presets for instruments\
\
Playback\
- what if you could hear what you were doing while you were doing it??\
	- probably will end up being some awkward thing but who cares\
\
Reading\
- This would be really hard but a way of making a pdf with sheet music on it from the music.\
	- You would need to use custom accidentals for the microtonal notes or have a much longer staff if you are using a number based EDO notation.\
